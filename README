= Readme for Swish-e Ruby Bindings

== Example usage
 require "swishe"
 sw=SwishE.new("swishe-index")
 sw.query("searchstring").each do |result|
   puts result.docpath
   puts result.rank
   # .... 
 end
 sw.close


 require "swishe"
 sw=SwishE.new("swishe-index")
 sw.search({"query" => "This is","order" => "swishdocsize asc","limit" => 1}).each do |result|
   puts result.docpath
   puts result.rank
   # .... 
 end
 sw.close

== Installing the bindings

You have two choices installing the bindings. First, use the gem command, such as
 gem install swishe
in case the gem command doesn't find the Swish-e C-library you might need to supply the path
to the library on the gem command line, for example:
 gem install swishe -- --with-swishe-dir=/opt/swishe/2.4.3/

The other way to install the ruby bindings for Swish-e would be to download the source file
and run setup.rb manually:
 ruby setup.rb all
and again, if your system doesn't find the Swish-e library, you need to supply those:
 ruby setup.rb all --  --with-swishe-dir=/opt/swishe/2.4.3/
Needles to say that you need to change the path according to your system requirements.
